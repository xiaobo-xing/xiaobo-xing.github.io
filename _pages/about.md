I am Xiaobo Xing, a Master’s graduate in Computer Science (Management) from the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at The University of Queensland. My research focuses on Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly their applications in multimodal reasoning and tabular data understanding.

Prior to my master’s studies, I received my Bachelor's degree in Information Engineering from Jilin University, where I conducted the thesis on deep learning-based anomaly detection in cyber-physical systems.

My academic background is complemented by practical experience as a full-time software engineer, during which I worked on backend development using Spring Boot and enterprise workflow systems. During my Master’s studies, I also served as a teaching assistant (tutor) for postgraduate coursework in *INFS7450* Social Media Analytics at The University of Queensland.

I am currently preparing to commence my PhD studies, where I will continue my research on multimodal LLMs, and their applications to tabular data.
